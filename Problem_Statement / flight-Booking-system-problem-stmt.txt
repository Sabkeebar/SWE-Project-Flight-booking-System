"The flight booking system project aims to create a comprehensive and user-friendly software solution 
for individuals  to search, compare and book flights, manage their reservations, and 
receive updates on their flight status. 

It requires the user to login with their email and password. The system allows the passenger to search for flights 
that are available between two preferred travel cities, namely the “Departure Airport” and “Arrival Airport” on 
specified departure and arrival dates. The system displays all the flight’s details such as flight number, Airline,
 and duration of flight etc.
 
 The software should have the ability to search for flights based on different criteria such as departure and arrival
cities, dates, number of stops,and preferred airlines.

 Additionally, the system should provide a secure payment gateway for booking confirmation, and it should also 
support payment through multiple channels.The software should be able to send out notifications to users regarding
flight schedule changes, cancellations,and other important information. The system should also allow users to manage 
their reservations, make changes to their bookings, and view their booking history. In addition, the system should 
provide customer support and helpdesk for users with any queries or issues related to their booking."
